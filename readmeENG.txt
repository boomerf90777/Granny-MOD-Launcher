Compilation requirement: Visual Studio 2022 (c++)

How to compile the program: 
Open Visual Studio 2022 and click on Build - Build Solution


How to install:
Files: GrannyLauncher.exe and GrannyLauncher.pdb move to the game folder, and MUST
create a folder mods (there will move your mods).
How to add mods to the program:
1. You need to download the mod itself, then create a folder to have the name_Mod (example: Legacy_Mod)
inside the folder should be the files themselves: .exe file, .dll, folders, etc.
2. Create in the mod folder mod.ini which should look like this:
Title=Your mod
Developer=Author
Year=any
Link=link
3. Go to the program (GrannyLauncher.exe), and select a mod (mod name = mod folder name
example: Legacy_Mod)
4. Click Launch Mod, and happy gaming!
P.S For this mod launcher, you need a LICENSED GRANNY from steam
