How to add mods to the program:
1. You need to download the mod itself, then create a folder with the name _Mod (for example: Legacy_Mod)
inside the folder, there should be the files themselves: .exe file, .dll, folders, etc.
2. Create a mod.ini file in the mod folder, which should look like this: 
Title=Your mod
Developer=Author
Year=any
Link=link
3. Go to the program (GrannyLauncher.exe), and select the mod (mod name = mod folder name
example: Legacy_Mod)
4. Click Launch Mod, and have fun!
